            <p>I specialise in the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web development/design</li>
                <li>Platform management</li>
                <li>IT and security</li>
                <li>Project management</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I am a huge believer in "substance over style", which largely explains the simplicity of this website. I am also a strong believer in the KISS principle - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Keep it Simple, Stupid!"</a>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Perth - my passion has always been within the IT and Web sector. Witnessing the growth of technology throughout the early 21st century have prompted me to follow this wave. I have worked at the Engineering Institute of Technology for over five years now - a business that offers online and on-campus engineering courses in both the Vocational and Higher Education sector. Our institute manages and maintains our information systems primarily in-house; chiefly as our requirements as a dual-sector organisation requires considerable customisation.</p>
            <p>My experiences have yielded the following: technology is logical - people are sometimes not. Project management and business process improvement has proved to be taxing at times, but my belief is that approaching all aspects of work as objectively as possible mitigates unhelpful conflict and justifies decisions.</p>

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.</p>
                <cite>Unknown</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>"Tech specialist" is the most apt descriptor for what I do, but unfortunately it limits how I define my role.  All aspects of technology interest me, but my specialisation is within the web design, development, and maintenance sectors.</p>
            <p>A lot of my work has been done on the big three CMS', these being WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career I often encounter scenarios where I think "why doesn't this exist" or "wish I knew this information previously". I make sure to take note of these instances, and in my spare time I look to either investigate these areas further, or ultimately just build my own solution. With this in mind, the primary reason for this website existing is to perform various tests on an Apache server, and also to share my experiences and solutions with the world :).</p>

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>
                I work full-time at the <a href="https://www.eit.edu.au/cms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineering Institute of Technology (EIT)</a>; my role is primarily coordination of projects (mostly technical). My original role of front-end designer and developer fell by the wayside (greater demand for project management), but since I find more enjoyment in full stack development, I use this website as an avenue to keep those skills in check.
            </p>
            <p>While I am more than happy to discuss any ad-hoc projects (website design, development, troubleshooting etc), I don't really offer any additional commercial services outside of EIT. I run this website as a hobby.</p>
